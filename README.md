# AI Art Generator API
A streamlined API for the CLIP+VQGAN AI Art Generator using Pytorch and FastAPI

## Overview


## Setup


## Demo
The API endpoints are divided as follows:
1. Generate Text2img: 
![generate text2img](images/)
this service allows the other services to interact with the GAN model and provide it
with text and the desired image size to generate paintings. Once this service is called, the model will be running in a separate thread to fine tune the image generator. As the generator is being finetuning, the model
will save intermediary images of the painting that the user asked for.
2. Generate Text2img Progressing: This service will allow the other services to access the latest intermediary
image generated by the model in its finetuning process.
3. Generate Text2img Progressbar: This service will allow the other services to access the current number of
iterations the model has finished so far in its finetuning process. This service is useful to show the user the
time left for the model to finish the painting generation.
4. Generate TextImg2img: This service allows the other services to interact with the GAN model and provide
it in addition to text with a starting image to generate an edited painting based on this image. Once this service is called, the model will be running in a separate thread to fine tune the image generator. As the generator is being finetuning, the model will save intermediary images of the painting that the user asked for.
